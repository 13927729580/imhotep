Imhotep is a large-scale analytics platform built by Indeed. For an introduction, check out the following tech talks:  

[Machine Learning at Indeed: Scaling Decision Trees](http://engineering.indeed.com/talks/machine-learning-indeed-scaling-decision-trees/) explains how we developed Imhotep, a distributed system for building decision trees for machine learning.

[Imhotep: Large-Scale Analytics and Machine Learning at Indeed](http://engineering.indeed.com/talks/imhotep-large-scale-analytics-machine-learning-indeed/) describes how we build large-scale interactive analytics tools using the same platform.

[Large-Scale Interactive Analytics with Imhotep](http://engineering.indeed.com/talks/large-scale-interactive-analytics-with-imhotep/) shows how our engineering and product organizations use Imhotep to focus on key metrics at scale. Additionally, Imhotep gives our marketing organization timely and accurate insight into our data.

## Features
Imhotep is a highly scalable analytics architecture that lets you do the following:

- Perform fast, interactive, ad hoc queries and aggregate results for large datasets 
- Combine results from multiple time-series datasets
- Build your own data tools for analysis, monitoring, reporting, and automated data processing on top of the Imhotep platform

At Indeed, we use Imhotep to answer the following and many more questions about how people around the world are using our job search engine:

- How many unique job queries were performed on a specific day in a specific country?
- What are the top 50 queries in a specific country? How many times did job seekers click on a search result for each of those queries?
- Which job titles have the highest click-through rate for the query `Architecture` in the US? Which titles have the lowest click-through rate?
