Imhotep is a large-scale analytics platform built by Indeed. This platform enables you to perform fast, interactive, ad hoc queries and aggregate results for large datasets.

Additionally, you can combine results from multiple time-series datasets and build your own data tools for analysis, monitoring, reporting, and automated data processing.

The following Indeed Tech Talks describe Imhotep in more detail:  <br><br>
