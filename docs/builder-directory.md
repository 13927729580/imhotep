## About Imhotep Builders

Imhotep Builders are integration tools that process data into an Imhotep dataset, by either:
* generating TSVs and uploading them with the [Imhotep TSV Uploader](http://opensource.indeedeng.io/imhotep/docs/quick-start/#imhotep-tsv-uploader) (recommended), or
* [writing Flamdex](https://github.com/indeedeng/imhotep/blob/master/imhotep-server/src/main/java/com/indeed/flamdex/simple/SimpleFlamdexDocWriter.java) indexes directly (advanced)

## Builder Directory

The list of all open source builders for Imhotep is maintained on the Imhotep wiki: **[Imhotep Builder Directory](https://github.com/indeedeng/imhotep/wiki/Imhotep-Builder-Directory)**
