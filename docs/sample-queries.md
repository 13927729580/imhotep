## World Cup 2014 Player Data

The following queries use data from [worldcupplayerinfo_20140701.tsv](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/files/worldcupplayerinfo_20140701.tsv) in the `worldcup2014` dataset and return data for `2014-07-01` to `2014-07-02`. 

Queries are grouped as follows:<br>
[Team Captains](#team-captains)<br>
[Clubs](#clubs)<br>
[Countries](#countries)<br>
[Age v Experience](#age-experience)<br>
[Jersey Numbers](#jersey)<br>
[Positions](#positions)<br>
[Groups](#groups)<br>

Since this is not typical time-series Imhotep data, all documents are assigned the same timestamp: `2014-07-01 00:00:00`

####<a name="captains"></a>Team Captains 

The following query returns the average age of captains and players of all other positions. The query also compares the number of appearances in the World Cup for the two groups of players. Team captains are on average almost 5 years older than other players and have 3 times as many national team appearances.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Captain select Age/count(), Selections/count()</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/team_captains_1.jpeg?raw=true)

The following query lists the captains, along with their club, country, position, and number of World Cup appearances.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 where Captain:1 group by Player, Country[], Club[], Position[] select Selections</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/team_captains_2.jpeg?raw=true)

####<a name="clubs"></a>Clubs

Barcelona has the most players in the World Cup (16), but Real Madrid/Man U have the most captains (2). Atletico Madrid has the highest average country rank for its players. Manchester City the oldest players, Schalke 4 the youngest.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Country select Age/count(), Selections/count()</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/countries.jpeg?raw=true)

####<a name="age-experience"></a>Age versus Experience

The following query compares player age to the number of World Cup appearances. Not surprisingly, the older you are, the more appearances you've had, in general.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Age select Selections/count()</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/age_vs_experience.jpeg?raw=true)

####<a name="jersey"></a>Jersey Numbers

The following query returns the number of players grouped by their jersey number. The query also returns the number of captains for each jersey number. Teams number all players 1-23. However, captains gravitate towards wearing #1, #4, #3, and #10.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Jersey select count(), Captain</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/jersey_number_1.jpeg?raw=true)

The following query groups documents by the player's jersey number and then, for each jersey number group, returns the most common position for that jersey number. Some numbers are typically associated with a position: #1 is always the goalie, defenders are frequently #2 and #3, and #9 is usually a forward.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Jersey, Position[1]</pre>

![Average Ages](http://indeedeng.github.io/imhotep/images/jersey_number_2.jpeg?raw=true)

####<a name="positions"></a>Positions

The following query returns the average player age and average number of World Cup appearances by their position. Goalies are older and more frequently the captain. Forwards typically have the most experience.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Position select count(),100*Captain/count(), Age/count(), Selections/count()</pre>

####<a name="groups"></a>Groups

The following query returns data about the World Cup groups: average number of World Cup appearances, average age, and average country rank. Group D and G were rough. Group F and H were easy. Group H was also the youngest and least experienced, while group C was the oldest and most experienced.

<pre>from worldcup2014 2014-07-01 2014-07-02 group by Group select Selections/count(), Age/count(), Rank/count()</pre>
