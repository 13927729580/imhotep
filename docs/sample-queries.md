Because IQL allows you to join multiple result tables from multiple IQL queries, you can see data from multiple indexes and time ranges or filtered in different ways at one time. This lets a job search engine like Indeed answer the following types of questions:

- How many unique queries were performed on a specific day in a specific state?
- What are the top 50 search queries in a specific state? How many clicks did each of those queries receive?
- What job titles have the highest click-through rate for the query "Architecture" in the US? What about the lowest click-through rate?

NOTE: Multiple queries should produce a result set that is consistent (has the same columns) and can be joined meaningfully.

This section walks you through sample queries using a public dataset.
