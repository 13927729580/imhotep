Because IQL allows you to join multiple result tables from multiple IQL queries, you can see data from multiple datasets and time ranges or filtered in different ways at one time. For example, at Indeed, we use Imhotep to answer these and many more questions about how people around the world are using our job search engine:

- How many unique job queries were performed on a specific day in a specific country?
- What are the top 50 queries in a specific country? How many times did job seekers click on a search result for each of those queries?
- Which job titles have the highest click-through rate for the query `Architecture` in the US? Which titles have the lowest click-through rate?

NOTE: Multiple queries should produce a result set that is consistent (has the same columns) and can be joined meaningfully.
