Because IQL allows you to combine the results from multiple datasets, you can answer the following types of questions about your data:

- How many unique queries were performed on a specific day in the US?
- What are the top 50 queries in Great Britain? How many clicks did each of those queries receive?
- For the last two weeks, what is the amount of revenue in every country by day for the top N groups?

This section walks you through sample queries using the public crunchbase dataset.
