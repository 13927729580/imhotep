The _proctor loader_ is responsible for loading the `test matrix` for an application. It ensures each test-definition is compatible with the application's specification. A single instance of a _proctor loader_ should be created for a application and be used when constructing its _AbstractGroupsManager_ generated class.

## AbstractProctorLoader
Proctor is bundled with several implementations of `AbstractProctorLoader` that can be used to load the `test matrix`. A custom loader can be implemented by extending `AbstractProctorLoader` or `AbstractJsonProctorLoader`.

**FileProctorLoader** - loads the test matrix from a specified file. At Indeed, all of our applications use this implementation to load a file containing the test matrix managed by our operations team. See the [deployment section][Deployment] for guidance on how to deploy the `test matrix` in this fashion.

**ClasspathProctorLoader** - loads the test matrix from a classpath resource. Useful for writing unit-tests involving Proctor or deploying the test matrix alongside the application.

**UrlProctorLoader** - loads the test from from a given url

**JsonProctorLoaderFactory** - factory class for configuring `FileProctorLoader` or `ClasspathProctorLoader`

Example usage in Java

```java
final JsonProctorLoaderFactory factory = new JsonProctorLoaderFactory();
// Loads the specification from the classpath resource 
factory.setSpecificationResource("classpath:/org/your/company/app/ExampleGroups.json");
// Loads the test matrix from a file
factory.setFilePath("/var/local/proctor/test-matrix.json");
final AbstractJsonProctorLoader loader = factory.getLoader();
```

Spring configuration xml

```xml
<bean id="loaderFactory" class="com.indeed.proctor.common.JsonProctorLoaderFactory">
    <!-- Loads the specification from the classpath resource -->
    <property name="specificationResource" value="classpath:/org/your/company/app/ExampleGroups.json" />
    <!-- Loads the test matrix from a file -->
    <property name="classResourcePath" value="/var/local/proctor/test-matrix.json" />
</bean>
<bean id="proctorLoader" factory-bean="loaderFactory" factory-method="getLoader" />
```

The `JsonProctorLoaderFactory` also supports loading the specification from the file system and test-matrix from the classpath. Both of these usages are rare but can be useful if you'd like to bundle the test-matrix with your application and do not need to update the test-matrix without deploying new code.

```xml
<bean id="loaderFactory" class="com.indeed.proctor.common.JsonProctorLoaderFactory">
    <!-- Load the specification resource from the file-system (not common) -->
    <property name="specificationResource" value="WEB-INF/org/your/company/app/ExampleGroups.json" />
    <!-- Load the test matrix from a classpath resource (not common) -->
    <property name="classResourcePath" value="/proctor/test-matrix.json" />
</bean>
<bean id="proctorLoader" factory-bean="loaderFactory" factory-method="getLoader" />
```

##  load-verify loop
The proctor loader periodically refreshes the `test matrix` and performs the following steps during each attempt:

1. Reads and parses the `test matrix` from a JSON file, classpath or url depending on the implementation of `AbstractJsonProctorLoader`. Invalid JSON preventing the deserialization of the `test matrix` will result in a failed recent attempt.
2. Checks the `audit.version` of the new test-matrix against the `audit.version` of last successful refresh. If these values are equal, the attempt is finished and no further steps are executed.
3. Validates each test in the `specification` against the corresponding `test-definition` in the `test matrix`:
  1. a test-definition should be defined for each test. A matrix missing a test is invalid.
  2. a test-definition allocating users to an bucket not defined in the specification is invalid. It's valid for the test-definition to define new buckets in it's `buckets` field, but their group size should be 0% across all test allocations.
  3. a test-definition must have valid payloads. If the application expects a test to have payloads, each bucket in the test-definition must have a payload of the correct type and pass the `payload-validator` expression. If an application doesn't expect a test to have payloads, no validation of their values is performed.
  4. a test-definition's allocations must each sum to 1.0
  5. a test-definition must have exactly one allocation with a null or empty rule. This allocation must be the last allocation in the `allocations` array.
4. 
5. Creates a new `Proctor` instance containing the data from the loaded `test matrix`. This instance is now considered the last successful test-matrix.

See the [inspecting the loader][Inspecting] for more details on how to determine if it has recently refreshed successfully.

## Scheduling the loader
The `AbstractProctorLoader` extends `java.util.TimerTask` and must be scheduled to run periodically.

Example: scheduling the loader to refresh every 30 seconds. Each of these examples creates a new ScheduledExecutorService specifically for the `AbstractJsonProctorLoader`. An application can reuse another ScheduledExecutorService if it already uses one for background tasks.

```java
...
final AbstractJsonProctorLoader loader = factory.getLoader();

final ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutorService = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(loader, 0, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

In Spring xml

```xml
...
<bean id="proctorLoader" factory-bean="loaderFactory" factory-method="getLoader" />
<bean id="scheduledExecutorService" class="org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorFactoryBean" lazy-init="false">
    <property name="threadNamePrefix" value="BackgroundTasks"/>
    <property name="continueScheduledExecutionAfterException" value="true"/>
    <property name="poolSize" value="1"/>
    <!-- Add all of the scheduled Tasks to the Executor Service -->
    <property name="scheduledExecutorTasks" >
        <list>
            <!-- scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(proctorLoader, 0, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS); -->
            <bean class="org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorTask">
                <property name="runnable" ref="proctorSupplier" />
                <property name="delay" value="0" />
                <property name="period" value="30000" />
                <property name="fixedRate" value="false" />
            </bean>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
```

## inspecting the loader state
Depending on the outcome of the `load-verify loop`, the loader may be one of many states:

`UNLOADED`: The loader has never successfully loaded the `test matrix`. This state can occur if the loader has yet to be run by the `ScheduledExecutorService` or the JSON file could not read or parsed.

`LOADED-COMPLETE`: The most recent refresh was successful and did not have any verification problems.

`LOADED-PARTIAL`: The most recent refresh parsed the `test matrix` successfully, but there were verification errors in at lease one of the `test defintions`.

`LOADED-STALE`: The most recent refresh was a failure: the `test matrix` could not be read or parsed. A previous attempt was successful and its test definitions will be used.

A combination of the following methods of _AbstractProctorLoader_ and _Proctor_ can be used to interpret the loader's state:

| method | descripton |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `boolean isLoadedDataSuccessfullyRecently()` | returns flag whose value indicates whether the most-recent refresh was successful. <br/>A `true` value indicates the loader is in the `LOADED-COMPLETE` or `LOADED-PARTIAL` state  |
| `Proctor loader.get()` | returns the currently loaded Proctor instance. <br/>This method will return `null` when in the `UNLOADED` state |
| `ProctorLoadResult Proctor.getLoadResult()` | returns a ProctorLoadResult instance describing the outcome of the most recent load. <br/> `ProctorLoadResult.hasInvalidTests` can be used to differentiate between the `LOADED-COMPLETE` and `LOADED-PARTIAL` states. |


```java
private enum ProctorRefreshState {
  UNLOADED,LOADED_COMPLETE,LOADED_PARTIAL,LOADED_STALE;
}

private ProctorRefreshState determineState(final AbstractProctorLoader loader) {
  // NOTE: this isn't exactly correct in multi-threaded context
  final Proctor proctor = loader.get();
  final boolean recentSuccess = loader.isLoadedDataSuccessfullyRecently();

  final ProctorRefreshState state;
  if(recentSuccess) {
    // LOADED-COMPLETE or LOADED-PARTIAL
    assert proctor != null;
    final ProctorLoadResult loadResult = proctor.getLoadResult();
    state = loadResult.hasInvalidTests() ? ProctorRefreshState.LOADED_PARTIAL : ProctorRefreshState.LOADED_COMPLETE;
  } else {
    // loader.getLastLoadErrorMessage() will contain the root cause of the failed attempt

    if(proctor == null) {
      state = ProctorRefreshState.UNLOADED;
    } else {
      state = ProctorRefreshState.LOADED_STALE;
      // similar to above, the ProctorLoadResult can be inspected to determine if the previous test matrix had any invalid test definitions
    }
  }
  return state;
}
```

## exporting the loader state
The `AbstractProctorLoader` extends [com.indeed.util.core.DataLoadingTimerTask][GithubUtil] and utilizes [VarExport][GithubUtilVarexport] to make it's state available for debugging. The _com.indeed.util.varexport.servlet.ViewExportedVariablesServlet_, can be used to view the exported namespaces and variables ([example web.xml][proctor-demo-web.xml]). 

| namespace and variable | description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `FileProctorLoader.last-audit` | JSON representation of _com.indeed.proctor.common.model.Audit_ containing matrix version information |
| `FileProctorLoader.last-error` | String containing the any error message from the most recent refresh |
| `ProctorLoaderDetail.file-source` | The source of the loader |
| `ProctorLoaderDetail.file-contents` | The raw contents of the loaded source-file |

note: the _FileProctorLoader_ namespace is the class name of the loader and will vary depending on the `AbstractProctorLoader` implementation being used by your application.
